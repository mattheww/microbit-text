# microbit-text

A Rust library for scrolling text on a 5×5 monochrome display.

This is designed to support the [micro:bit]'s 5×5
display, though nothing in this crate is strictly specific to the micro:bit.
In practice it should be used with the [`microbit`] crate.

It includes a copy of the 'pendolino' font from the [micro:bit runtime][dal].
